### Reopen Vote Reviewers of SO is a chat room dedicated to help users with the reopening process of closed posts on Stack Overflow. 

All users are welcome to participate in the chat room, either to propose to reopen a post, or just to chill around and chat.
Here are some rules to be followed if you are going to participate in the room:

### To propose to reopen a post...

   1) ***Use the proper tags:***  
      To make it clear that you are proposing to reopen a post, include in your proposal the [tag:reopen-pls] tag, 
      followed by the main programming tag(s) of the post (optional, but recommended)*.
      If you are proposing to reopen your own post, include the [tag:mine] tag as a disclosure.

   2) ***Explain why the post warrants a reopening:***  
      The focus here is why you believe that the post you proposed to reopen should be reopened.
      Was it an edit made after closure that fixed the former issues of the post, or is there a reason why the post shouldn't have been closed in the first place? 
      Be elaborate to avoid misunderstandings.

   3) ***Do not fire and forget:***  
      Once you have posted your proposal and given an explanation as to why you're making the proposal, 
      stay and wait in case of questions and/or clarifications needed about your request.
      If you need leave right after making your request for any reason, or ignore questions regarding your request, your request will be binned, 
      though feel free to make that request again when you know you'll have the time and use the time to stick around and answer potential questions.
      
   4) ***Example reopening proposal:***  
      [tag:reopen-pls] [tag:python] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/.../example-question-link  
      I'm proposing to reopen the post closed as Needs Details Or Clarity due to important relevant code previously missing in the post.
      The code is now added by the OP, and I understand the problem clearly now.

### Casting a reopen vote on a proposed post...

   1) ***Proposal must be accompanied by an explanation before you cast a vote:***  
      Wait for an explanation from the user who proposed the reopening of the post before casting your vote. 
      You may explain the reason yourself if necessary, but do not cast a reopen vote without any explanation to accompany the proposal.
      Violating this rule a few times might be passed as a coincidence of reviewing timings, but if such suspicious patterns continue,
      you will eventually be banned from the room.

### You can chat about almost anything in the room that doesn't violate the code of conduct, though here are few emphasis...

   1) ***Shady conversations are forbidden:***  
      Discussions on planned out voting patterns that causes harm to the site will have you banned from the chat room.
   
   2) ***Avoid sensitive topics:***  
      Do not talk about sensitive subjects that can offend a group of people. Try to keep the room welcoming to everyone.
   
   3) ***Do not make any personal attacks:***  
      Do not make any personal attacks, period.
   
   4) ***English is mandatory:***  
      English is mandatory in the chat room, as it's the English Stack Overflow. 
      This is *not* a rule that you can quote to users who are using English with merely grammatical errors, typos, etc.

### Rule for ROs (room owners) when moderating the chat room...

   1) ***Do not abuse your privileges:***  
      Do not abuse any privileges given to you as a RO to do things that are for your personal consent.
      Example of violations of this rule are: 
       - Unstarring starred messages that you personally disagree with.
       - Kicking a user for posting messages that you personally disagree with.
       - Moving messages that you personally disagree with to the trash bin.
      Use your privileges only when needed. Abusing your privileges will eventually have you removed as a RO.
   
   2) ***Be patient with users:***  
      Unless a serious violation of the code of conduct was made, 
      do not be so quick to kick a user out of the room for doing something against the rules.
      Instead, calmly let them know what they did wrong (don't be snarky), and see if they accept to change.
      
   3) ***Meeting with ROs before appointing new ROs:***  
      Before appointing any other user as a RO, discuss the matter with the existing ROs to get their consent.
      If any of the existing ROs are inactive or not responding for any reason after at least 48 hrs from when you pinged them,
      you may assume that the RO doesn't have a problem with the appointing of a RO.
